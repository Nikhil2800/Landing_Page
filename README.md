Steps Taken : 

1. Plan our Layout : 
Sketch out a rough layout design for landing page, considering the placement of key 
elements such as the featured car section, call-to-action buttons, navigation menu, and 
footer.

2. Set Up HTML Structure : 
Create an HTML file for your landing page.
Define the basic structure including header, main and footer sections.
Within the <main> section, create containers for different content sections such as the 
featured car, vehicle details, gallery, testimonials, and contact information.

3. Add Bootstrap Framework: 
Link HTML file to the Bootstrap, CSS stylesheet and JavaScript files. 
Utilize Bootstrap classes to create responsive grid layouts, typography, buttons, forms, and 
other components.

4. Apply CSS Styling : 
Link HTML file to a CSS file.
Use custom CSS to add additional styling and fine-tune the design to match branding and 
visual preferences.
Override Bootstrap styles as needed to achieve the desired look and feel.

5. Design the Featured Car Section : 
Create a visually striking section at the top of the page showcasing the featured car(s).
Include high-quality images, a captivating headline, and key features or highlights of the 
car.
Use Bootstrap's grid system to structure the layout and ensure responsiveness.

6. Vehicle Details Section: 
Provide detailed information about the featured car(s), including specifications, 
performance metrics, available trim levels, and pricing.
Use Bootstrap typography and styling classes to format the text and create an organized 
layout.

7. Contact Information : 
Display contact information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and location details 
in the footer section.
Optionally, include a contact form for visitors to submit inquiries or schedule 
appointments.

8. Optimization : 
Optimize this CSS code for performance by minimizing file size and reducing unnecessary 
styles.
Compress any images used on the page to improve loading times.

9. Final Touches:
Review the page to ensure all content is accurate and up-to-date.
Make any final adjustments to the layout or styling as needed.
